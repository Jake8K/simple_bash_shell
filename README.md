# simple_bash_shell

To compile the shell simply include the makefile into the same directory as smallsh.c.
Next, navigate to the directory in bash and enter the "make" command to compile the
program "smallsh."

Alternatively, if you do not wish to use the makefile, simply enter:
	" gcc -g smallsh.c -o smallsh " 
	
To run the shell, enter "smallsh" in bash. You're now in the shell.

To exit the shell, enter "exit" into smallsh.
To remove the executable from the directory, enter the command "make clean"
